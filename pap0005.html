        <h1>Paper Review: Multi-class Semantic Segmentation of Faces</h1>
        <h2>...</h2>

        <h3>How did I encounter</h3>
        After I finished the book 'Deep Learning from Scratch' with my study mates, Enraged Emu, we started the project about MBTI predictor based on human faces.
        I thought that we need to separate some irrelevant features from the pictures, since the features could lead the model to overfitting.
        After I applied FCN with ResNet101, I found this paper from <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/PyTorch-Segmentation-torchvision/intro-seg.ipynb#scrollTo=_mQVy39SeQ1B">this colab page</a>.
