        <h1>Paper Review: Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation</h1>
        <h2>The first introduced FCN paper</h2>

        <h3>How did I encounter</h3>
        After I finished the book 'Deep Learning from Scratch' with my study mates, Enraged Emu, we started the project about MBTI predictor based on human faces.
        I thought that we need to separate some irrelevant features from the pictures, since the features could lead the model to overfitting.
        I heard a bit about FCN, so I tried the model.
